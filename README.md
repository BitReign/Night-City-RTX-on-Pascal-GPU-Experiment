What is this?
===================

Started as an unnamed R&D project then wanted to share with anyone who owns supported Pascal GPU and want to test RTX without any leg work. It's a basic experiment with Ray Tracing features in Unreal Engine on Pascal GPU (mine was GTX 1070). As a conclusion, it has far exceeded my expectations on this GPU.

To enable Ray Tracing, Support Compute Skincache must be enabled for the project. If it is not already enabled, youâ€™ll receive a message dialogue asking if you would like to enable it now. If so, click Yes.

Restart the engine to launch the Editor with DX12 and to enable Ray Tracing for your project.
